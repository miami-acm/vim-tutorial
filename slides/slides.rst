Vim is the fastest text editor in the world. There is no program that lets
you effortlessly edit source code as well as Vim does.

    "Out of all the open software I've ever seen and used, and I've seen
    alot, Vim is the best, most useful and highest quality to work with,
    second only to the linux kernel itself."

    -- Peter Jay Salzman
