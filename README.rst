Intro
=====

Vim is the fastest text editor in the world. There is no program that lets
you effortlessly edit source code as well as Vim does.

    "Out of all the open software I've ever seen and used, and I've seen
    alot, Vim is the best, most useful and highest quality to work with,
    second only to the linux kernel itself."

    -- Peter Jay Salzman

Why Vim?
========

1. Modal editing

    - Separate modes for inserting and navigating text
    - Whole keyboard can be used for commands
    - Several commands just used for entering insert mode in specific places
    - Define new commands/macros as needed

Why Vim?
========

2. Text objects

    - Operate on whole sections of text based on their delimiters
    - Repeat commands in an instant

Why Vim?
========

3. Composition of commands

    - Repeating commands is a fundamental part of Vim
    - Can repeat any command any number of times
    - Makes repetitive text editing jobs incrediby easy
